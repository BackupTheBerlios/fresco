A simple "desktop" consisting of a PNG raster image.

This client will attach a PNG to the desktop (hence the name wallpaper). Only
PNGs located in {berlin-prefix}/share/PNG/ can be loaded.

The default raster is berlin-128.png. Use  --raster=<value> to load
a different PNG.  

ie 'wallpaper --raster=foo.png' will load /usr/local/share/Berlin/PNG/foo.png

Bugs:
-The raster is not scaled or centered yet. Pick a PNG that fits your server's 
 pixel resolution (the default is 640x480.)
-If you kill the client the raster will stay on the scenegraph.
-You must run wallpaper as the first client. It does not insert itself into
 the scenegraph properly.
