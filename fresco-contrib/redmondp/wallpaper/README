This client will attach a png to the desktop (hence the name wallpaper).  Only
PNGs located in {berlin-prefix}/share/PNG/ can be loaded.

The default raster is berlin-128.png. Use  --raster (or -r) <value> to load
a different PNG.  

ie --raster foo.png will load /usr/local/share/Berlin/PNG/foo.png

Bugs:
The raster is not scaled or centered yet.  Pick a PNG that fits your server's 
pixel resolution (the default is 640x480.)

If you kill the client the raster will stay on the scenegraph.
