It's a progress meter prototype. Note that the real thing should be controlled using a
BoundedValue which the progress bar should be observing. At the moment it runs an
automated demo bouncing back and forth. This illistrates a bug in some Consoles where the
window only animates while the mouse is moving. That is clearly the wrong behaviour so
this doubles as a testcase for that problem.
