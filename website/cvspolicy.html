<h1>CVS policy</h1>
<i>How the project CVS module is administered and who is responsible</i>
<p>
This is basically a meta-project. It gives individual Fresco developers CVS space and other resources (e.g. webspace, if needed) to use for their own Fresco projects.
<p>
Every developer will have his own subdir (called after the BerliOS user name) in the CVS module, which he manages himself. The directory organisation and the content is completely up to the developer, as long as it's
<ul>
<li>related to Fresco
<li>not offensive
<li>within with rules of BerliOS
<li>not unreasonably large (i.e. don't check in your mpgs here, because some people might want to check out the whole module at once)
</ul>
<p>
Especially appreciated will be nice clients for Fresco, easy to build and run, so we have something to use with Fresco.
But almost anything useful to Fresco is welcome - documentation, papers etc..
<p>
Because the space is intended to be public and be checked out by interested peer developers and Fresco users, it is good manners to document the purpose, state and license of your code.<br>
WHAT-IS-THIS files, READMEs, comments at the top of the source etc. are well-suited.
Write what the code is intended to do, maybe why you wrote it and how you rate its quality yourself.
<p>
Note that everything has to be under an Open-Source license.
A reference to a license is enough, we don't need 15 copies of the LGPL, but that's up to you, as long as the license is clear.
<p>
Absolutely disallowed are checkins to other developer's directories, unless explicitly allowed to.<br>
Admins may take over orphaned directories and solve immediate problems (like files of several MBs).
<p>
If you are a developer and wrote a little client for Fresco, even if it's just some hacky code that you wrote to get familar with Fresco, sign up for BerliOS and request being added as developer, then check in whatever you have.
<p>
Let the information flow free! :-)
